# Widget API: WP_Widget_Recent_Posts_In_Category

This is a new widget cloned from WordPress's core Recent Posts widget that I added Category selection to.

I couldn't find a good and simple plugin to do it, which is odd, but everything was either old and custom coded (and not great) or it had every single bell and whistle included and I just didn't need that.

Needed this for a client site. Needed to be simple and fast. It's literally WP's widget, with category added. Simple.

Should it be a plugin and in the repo? you tell me. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
